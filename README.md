# Project Title

## Description of the Project

I made a car dealership application in Java. It lets users view and manage car inventory easily. I added features to add, remove, and search for cars. I also made the program interactive with a user-friendly interface. This project helped me practice object-oriented programming and file handling.

## User Stories

List the user stories that guided the development of your application. Format these stories as: "As a [type of user], I want [some goal] so that [some reason]."

- As a user, I want to view all cars in the inventory so that I can see what is available for purchase.
- As a user, I want to search for a car by make, model, or year so that I can find the exact car Iâ€™m looking for.
- As a user, I want to add a new car to the inventory so that I can keep the list up-to-date.
- As a user, I want to remove a car from the inventory so that sold or unavailable cars are no longer listed.
- As a user, I want the program to save and load the inventory from a file so that my changes are not lost when I close the application.
## Setup

Instructions on how to set up and run the project using IntelliJ IDEA.

### Prerequisites
